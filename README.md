A blockchain application will be created which will contain a few features making it easier to vote compared to the current system.
Features inlcude automatic creation of an e-Voter ID when an Indian citizen turns 18. This has an additional benefit that no eligible voter will be left out of the voter's list. Also a new and innovative exit poll will take place wherein after about 3 hours, a live prediction will be broadcasted based on extrapolation from randomly selected 10% of the total votes given. This will help the upcoming voters in their decision making process.
