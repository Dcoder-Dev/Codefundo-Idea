Idea For Codefundo++

The main idea is to completely transport the election process online. This will solve quite a few problems. 
Due to blockchain technology and its security, votes can't be tampered with easily. Instead of people walking all the way to a voting booth, they should be able to vote sitting in the comfort of their homes.
A lot of problems arise due to problems of domicile and voting list registration. Using blockchain, each block will have the details of voters and their votes with added security.
Due to this, tampering in the elections should go down significantly. Also, it's a people friendly approach.
